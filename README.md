# Proposal: `pymc-experimental` repository

As PyMC continues to mature and expand its functionality to accomodate more domains of application, we increasingly see cutting-edge methodologies, highly specialized statistical distributions, and complex models appear. While this adds to the functinoality and relevance of the project, it can also introduce instability and impose a burden on testing and quality control. To help address this, a `pymc-experimental` respository could act as a home for new additions to PyMC, which may include unusual probability distribitions, advanced model fitting algorithms, or any code that may be inappropriate to include in the `pymc` repository, but may want to be made available to users.

## Questions

### What belongs in `pymc-experimental`?


### What does not belong in `pymc-experimental`?


### Should `pymc-experimental` be a submoduke?


### Should there be more than one add-on repository?


### How can we minimize the additional burden of additional project repositories?
